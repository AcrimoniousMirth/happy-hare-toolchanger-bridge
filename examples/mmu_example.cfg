# Happy Hare MMU Master Config Example
# This file demonstrates the recommended way to include all components
# in a deterministic order for Toolchanger setups.

# 1. Hardware & Parameters (Define pins and sensors first)
[include mmu_hardware.cfg]
[include mmu_parameters.cfg]
[include mmu_macro_vars.cfg]

# 2. Mandatory Happy Hare software macros
[include mmu_software.cfg]
[include mmu_sequence.cfg]
[include mmu_state.cfg]

# 3. Other optional components
[include mmu_cut_tip.cfg]
[include mmu_form_tip.cfg]
[include mmu_leds.cfg]
[include mmu_purge.cfg]

# 4. Toolchanger Bridge Integration
# We load this after the HH macros so it can correctly hook into them.
[include mmu_toolchanger_bridge.cfg]
